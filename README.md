# FINDINGS
    # higher max temperatures closer to the equator (-20 to 40) -- closer to the sun
    # more cities in the northern hemisphere -- the northern hemisphere is more industrialized and larger landmass
    # lower humidity between both -35 to 0, and 20 to 40 -- highest humidity is near the equator
    # least cloudiness between 0 to 20 -- higher amount of sunshine related to less cloudiness
    
# Everything is in the WeatherPy folder, the Output folder includes my charts, etc.
